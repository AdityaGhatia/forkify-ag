# Secure Web Application

This project is a secure web application developed to provide basic functionalities like to login and sign up while implementing essential security features to protect against common cyber threats.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Implements a secure user authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access the application.
2. **Input Validation**: Applies input validation techniques to prevent common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
3. **Session Management**: Implements secure session management to protect user sessions from hijacking or unauthorized access.
4. **Secure Password Storage**: Utilizes proper password hashing techniques to securely store user passwords.
5. **Error Handling**: Implements secure error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
6. **HTTPS Implementation**: Enables HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
7. **Security Headers**: Adds security headers to HTTP responses to enhance the overall security posture of the application.

## Usage

- The application provides functionalities like login and Sign up.

## Security Considerations

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- Perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential security flaws.
- Educate users about security best practices, such as using strong passwords and being cautious of phishing attempts.
- Monitor logs and implement intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to security incidents.
